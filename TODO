Major pieces of functionality planned for 1.1 and/or 1.2 --

  - Implement a hierarchical/wavelet formulation of Hat/PWC/PWL for muscle
    functions. Using a full Hermite there is often wasteful and expensive.

  - Rid ourselves of the ADOL-C dependency. The system is currently slow
    to the point where it is nearly useless -- ADOL-C ruins the complexity
    of the process, which could well be quadratic in the DOF.

  - As part of the state dumping process (which happens each iteration),
    write all state variables in a form that can be read back by a model,
    allowing continuation of a previous run, possibly after fiddling with
    constraints, objective functions, etc.

  - Read a model definition on start-up, possibly using some known
    3D format. Possibly read scenario construction definitions also?

  - Completely rewrite the Visualizer, which is currently an awful hack.


Minor possible improvements along the way --

  - Give all physical entities a name?
  - Handle proper deallocation and class deconstruction?
  - Tighten up consistency checks during the scenario construction
    so that it becomes next to impossible to set things up wrong?
  - Rewrite force/impulse handling?


Conceivable future plans:

  - Perhaps one day there will be some sort of graphical interface?
